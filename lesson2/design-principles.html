        <p>
          Essentially, this is a way of page layout that visually conveys the
          order and importance of content. The visual hierarchy is created by
          drawing certain cues (such as size, color, contrast, shape, position,
          and arrangement) to create a sense of depth. We experience visual
          levels every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to provide you with a simple daily example, please consider
          what is most likely to jump out when you scroll through Samsung’s
          black, gray, and white interfaces? Of course a bold brand!
        </p>
        <p>
          Although visual hierarchy is a key principle of website and product
          design, the concept itself is by no means difficult to grasp. However,
          handling it correctly will most likely require trial and error.

        <p>
          Hick’s Law predicts that the time and effort required to make a choice
          will increase as the number of choices increases.
        </p>
        <p>
          When response time is important, reduce the number of options. One to
          five is a good rule of thumb. Don’t you want to use all these buttons?
          Too many options with an equally perceived hierarchy can lead to
          analysis paralysis. This often leads to frustration. Not the best user
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the contrary, systems with fewer options and clearer options are
          often rated by users as having a better user experience.

        <p>
          Fitts' law states that the amount of time a person needs to move a
          pointer (such as a mouse cursor) to the target area is a function of
          the distance to the target divided by the size of the target.
          Therefore, the longer the distance, the smaller the size of the target
          and the longer it takes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This law is widely used in user experience (UX) and user interface
          (UI) design. For example, the law affects the practice of making
          interactive buttons larger (especially on finger-operated mobile
          devices)-clicking smaller buttons is more difficult (and time
          consuming). Likewise, the distance between the user's task/attention
          area and the button related to the task should be kept as short as
          possible.
