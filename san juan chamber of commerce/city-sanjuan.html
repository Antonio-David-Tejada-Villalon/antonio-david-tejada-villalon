        <h3>San Juan</h3>
        <p>
          The history of San Juan includes many transformations that have
          resulted in a province that combines a unique style and idiosyncrasy.

          <h4>History</h4>
          <div class="history">
            <p>
              Let’s start at the beginning: On June 13 in 1562, the City of San
              Juan was founded by Juan Jufré in the Huarpe Valley of Tucuma. At
              the time, Juan Jufré used a plan with a simple layout, dividing it
              into 25 blocks, with the Plaza Mayor in the center. In 1594, San
              Juan had its seat in what is now known as Concepción, a district
              located in the Capital. But at the end of 1593, a flood of the San
              Juan River swept the city, which was moved 25 blocks from its
              original location. The city began to grow again and more strongly
              into what we know today as the Province of San Juan, composed of 19
              departments. At the beginning of the 20th century, important works
              were carried out, such as the Cathedral, the Episcopal Palace and
              the Santo Domingo Church, the Government Palace, the Social Club and
              Casa España. An earthquake affected the city in 1894, causing
              serious material damage with significant damage to the buildings,
              creating rubble-covered streets. The Government Palace, inaugurated
              ten days before, suffered an almost complete destruction of the
              upper floor. Currently, the city of San Juan has modern buildings
              such as the Bicentennial Theater that is the icon of the Cuyo
              Cultural Center.

          <h4>Geography</h4>
          <div class="geography">
            <p>
              Many things make San Juan a different, attractive and unique
              province. One of those things is its particular geography, which
              leaves us with mental pictures that will never go away. San Juan is
              located in western Argentina and is part of the Cuyo Region. Its
              landscape offers snow peaks, mountains, rivers, valleys, and an open
              sky, which is the best way to light up all these. Humans have
              transformed the landscape, making the mountainous relief coexist
              with flat and habitable landscapes. The province is guarded by three
              large mountainous structures: the Andes Mountain Range to the West,
              the Pre-Mountain Range, and The Sierras Pampeanas to the East. The
              Andes Mountain Range is always present and extends, longitudinally,
              from north to south and to the west. In the center, next to the
              Mountain Range, is the Pre-Mountain Range, which goes along the
              province of San Juan. It is in the mountain summits that rivers
              arise, including Jáchal, Bermejo and the Valle River, fed by rains.
              The most important river carries the same name as the Province, the
              San Juan River, with three tributaries that originate in the snows
              of the Andes Mountain Range. It is born more than 4000 meters high
              and descends to 650 meters in the Tulum Valley. This descent can be
              used as a source of energy. The entire province benefits from the
              mighty waters of this river. In fact, in order to take full
              advantage of it, the Punta Negra and Los Caracoles dam and
              hydroelectric power plant was put into operation. This initiative
              promotes the growth of the province, guarantees a greater arable
              land, and increases the production of energy and priceless tourism
              development. San Juan has protected areas made up of more than 2
              million hectares, including: San Guillermo National Park – San
              Guillermo Biosphere Reserve, Ischigualasto Provincial Park – Natural
              Heritage Site, Valle Fertil Provincial Park –Don Carmelo Multiple
              Use Reserve, President D. F. Sarmiento – Cerro Alkazar Natural
              Monument – Los Morrillos Wildlife Private Refuge – Lagunas de
              Guanacache Ramsar Site – El Leoncito National Park –Loma de las
              Tapias Natural Park and Protected Landscape –Pedernal Protected
              Landscape.
